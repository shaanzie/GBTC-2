Second Idea for Codefundo++ 2019

In the advent of decentralised architectures using technologies such as peer-peer networks and blockchains, the concept of secure transactions and information storage has taken a huge leap in terms of their applications and usage in real-world scenarios. The application to voting systems, however, is unexplored in India. Our project aims to solve the hassles of voting procedures.

The problem lies significantly in the areas of registration, updating details and other tiresome procedures of the election. The time taken by these systems to update systems in this environment is slow and not exactly tamper-proof.

Our project deals with a new systemic architecture for the election system, involving connecting relevant government bodies with a decentralised networking environment. Here the central servers of each constituency themselves are linked together by a blockchain, the central servers also have child nodes which are the servers having the individual EVM votes. The goal of decentralising is to ensure that each constituency inherently governs only the nodes of its children. The constituency level is the highest in the hierarchy, with no central governance, and the information transfer happens through the blockchain managed by a ledger suited to the constituency needs. This also helps in pinpointing errors to a constituency and thus recounts can be made much easier and faster. 



This system can also solve a few more problems. Identity authentication of people not belonging to the native constituency can be handled as well. Vote counting can also be expedited using this idea, where each block can keep a tally of that constituency's votes and the votes can be tallied almost instantly through the nodes of the blockchain. Misplacement of eligible voters from the Voter List can be validated using the central ledger, keeping account of all registered voters and matching it with the ledger containing the transactions on the voter list for each constituency. Thus solving the missing name from voter list issue as well.
